This repository contains configuration to help Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, http://globalbioticinteractions.org) find and index biotic association records of the Consortium of Small Vertebrate Collections .

From https://csvcoll.org/portal/ : 

> The Consortium of Small Vertebrate Collections is a growing network of research, academic, and museum institutions focused on the study of birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. It is a collaborative venture of iDigBio and Arizona State University and provides a mechanism for network members to manage and share biodiversity data to scientists and the general public. Participating institutions are afforded sophisticated online data management tools without the need for onsite IT support.
